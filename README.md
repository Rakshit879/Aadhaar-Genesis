# Project Description

Doc2Door is a full-stack web application built using React and Firebase that simplifies the process of generating and managing essential documents for newborns. The platform allows hospital staff to fill in birth details through a dedicated form, which are then securely uploaded and automatically forwarded to the concerned government authorities for birth certificate processing. Parents can access and download the birth certificate directly from the portal without the need to visit any physical office. After five years, the platform provides parents the option to schedule an Aadhaar card registration appointment for their child at a preferred date and time. An authorized agent visits their home to collect biometric data, such as fingerprints, required for Aadhaar generation. Once the Aadhaar card is issued, parents can securely download the document from the portal. The application features secure authentication using Firebase Auth and real-time data storage with Firestore, creating a seamless experience for both hospitals and parents.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
